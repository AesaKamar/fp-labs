# fp-labs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aesakamar/scala-demos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aesakamar/scala-demos)

##How to use this?

This project is structured as a series of self paced labs. 

Within `fp-labs/src/test/scala/labs` there are several files which each describe a concept from Functional Programming. 

You can follow along in an `sbt` shell by running the tests for that specific module and reading along through the exercises. 

For example, to run a single lesson, implemented as a test suite, you can run `sbt:fp-labs> testOnly labs.troposphere.Immutability`
